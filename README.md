# Oreo Cursors (Redistributed)

This repository contains a redistributed version of the Oreo Cursors theme, originally created by [varlesh](https://github.com/varlesh/oreo-cursors). The original project was found to have some build issues, which have been fixed in this version.

## About This Repository

The cursors in this repository are pre-compiled and ready to use. This approach was taken due to the following reasons:

1. The original build process was broken and required fixes.
2. Compiling the cursors can be time-consuming (up to 15 minutes on some systems).
3. To make the cursors more accessible to users who may not have the necessary tools or knowledge to compile them from source.

## Installation

### Linux

1. Download the cursor theme you want from this repository. OR
2. If you want to download all themes just:
   - `~git clone https://github.com/milkmadedev/oreo-cursors-compiled/`
3. Move the extracted folder to one of these locations:
   - `~/.icons/` (for current user only)
   - `/usr/share/icons/` (for all users, requires root permissions)
